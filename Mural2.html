                        <strong>Analysis of Potential Impact on the Public Sphere</strong>
                    </h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Methology and Theory</strong>:When analyzing the affordances of murals in terms of revealing the agency to assert identity in a particular space, I must look at it as an act of human territoriality. A group must claim the space by marking something public (like a building) to inscribe their own claim (mural). Further, this claim made public renders visible a certain ethos about that space. To explore Asian American’s agency in achieving territoriality through murals, first a mural’s claim (emitted and presented) must be decoded, particularly in its relationship between identity and the place it is inscribed on.  As a heuristic for decoding, Keating’s cognitive, affective, and instrumental lenses (86) for looking at place will be effective in breaking apart the nuances of a mural’s claim. Cognitive relation informs the territorial or symbolic shape of a place, thus defining its limits and distinctions; Affective relation informs feelings toward the region and the degree to which it forms a common identity; and Instrumental relation informs how the region is used for a particular action.  Furthermore, it is not enough to simply decode the mural’s claim. Within the visual field that a mural presents itself, the space may also be negotiated, supported, or contested by surrounding material actants. Thus, along with the mural’s claim, I also look at how the claim is reproduced and maintained through surrounding material networks in its field of vision.</p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis</strong>: If Chinatown’s Vincent Chin mural demonstrated how an Asian American territorialization can prove stagnant and contested by unparallel visible network of surrounding material markers, a later attempt at a Vincent Chin mural on Grand River Avenue reveals how more active material networks and stakeholders may overpower Asian American claims of space. More specifically, Grand River Avenues’ repeated reconstructions of the public space actively negotiate territoriality but as a result, continuously destabilize local identity, such as the attempted Asian American claim to that space.</p>

                    <p>Since the project’s development has produced active contestations and rewritings of murals as a form of dialogue in defining the local area and community, the economies of visibility and public attention via murals in this instance have clear claims of territorialization in terms of local artists and local community identity, but as a site that’s constantly deterritorialized, affective claims to local identity (the who that is claiming this territory) is continually destabilized. Unlike the less active but more stabilized identity-boundaries of Chinatown’s Peterboro-Cass corner, Grand River avenue’s identity is problematized by a continually practiced and active negotiation of place identity and local ownership. Material clusters of rotating murals, consenting building owners, and even strategically placed benches work as a material network to reinforce a stable territory of practice, though local identity is constantly negotiated. A large part of the public domain is negotiated through the dialogue of rewritten, replaced, and even defaced murals. Stakeholders such as local artists, building owners, and affiliative organizations have agency in what defines the community by negotiating through these mural presentations.</p>
                    <p>Though an APA-oriented organization signed off on the mural, it was the artist’s non-local identity and message that made the mural an instant target of local resistance. Street artist Sintax painted over the mural to contest the Baltimore artist and further admonishes, “This just is not just painting some bullshit ass mural about what you think my city is.” Though it is offered as an Asian American message and approved by a local Asian American group, its affective dimensions toward a local identity are complicated by various implied boundaries that have been perceived and contested by the community: Chin’s relation to Highland Park, Gaia’s relation to Baltimore, to even the mural’s relation to global events. Here, cognitive and affective claims to space and local identity are complicated between networks of local authenticity and identity-representative iconography. Gaia, while noting the problematics of revitalization through outside art, articulated this clash in his response, “Buffing the memory of Vincent Chin is a misplaced critique on the murals that are clashing with graffiti. Instead it comes off as a gesture against the Asian community of michigan” (Pisacane). Though Sintax’s main contention with the piece was its nonlocal affiliations, he accedes to the representative and community-identifying power of iconography by repainting the mural to include Vincent Chin, among other famous victims of hate crimes (DeVito). What follows is justification through Sintax’s affiliation as a local artist who knows local tastes and concerns.</p>
                    <p>The local/outsider turf war has been a reoccurring issue for Grand River Creative Corridor, showcasing how repetitive claims of space struggle to stabilize place-identity through processual events and surrounding parallel material networks of, in this case, murals. Furthermore, the contention between Sintax and Gaia also represent how a more prominent network of local territory can work to overpower and manipulate the perception of iconography and identity-relations. Again, visible actants can play multiple roles for various networks, and Sintax reappropriated Vincent Chin to be a part of a different claim to space, one that is inherently local in production and ethos.  Ultimately, for the Asian American community who had stake in the mural’s message, Asian American claim to space is contested again, but in this instance, through a more overpowering network of locality which is continually reinforced and supported by surrounding murals with locally produced narratives.</p>
