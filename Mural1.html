                        <strong>Analysis of Potential Impact on the Public Sphere</strong>
                    </h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Methology and Theory</strong>: To investigate the Filipinx community’s ability to lodge claims for recognition, acceptance, and inclusion in the public sphere through physical markers, a theoretical framework must take into account analysis of material claims to space in relation to public attention. The concept of Regimes of Publicity provides one such framework for deciphering how material claims function within the system of laws, practices, and relations that condition qualities of a public. Developed by Staehali, Mitchell, and Nagel (2008), regimes of publicity assumes not everyone has access and voice within a public space to be representative within the public sphere. A number of socially agreed upon rules already influence economies of public attention which Staeheli, Mitchell, and Nagel outline in three sets of relationships: (1) community and social norms – some sense of commonality with the public through aligned concern(s) or history. This commonality and ability to interact in interpretable ways influences the chances of a message’s uptake from strangers willing to engage in discussion over the message. (2) Legitimacy – claims must be seen as normal, unremarkable, and legitimate by already existent notions of publicity. This may be difficult for groups vying for public access because they’re already viewed as illegitimate, so many strategies may include demonstrating how practices may be seen as legitimate in other senses. (3) Relations of property – the relationships that exist in and through place which regulate who can make claims in that area. Though Staehali, Mitchell, and Nagel emphasize the rights of a locale as influenced by property ownership, it also points to spatialized access that is not just read from a singular physical place, “but also the set of relationships and rights that make property meaningful as a form of wealth, as a resource in building places and structuring activities, and as imbued with power” (p. 643). This last point draws connections with networks of spatiality and can perhaps be seen as a material form of semiotics that work to uphold certain public narratives—or in the authors’ case, what is already regulated by property ownership.</p>
                    <p>Regimes of publicity and its application on political geography draw from a number of key theorists.  The concept underscores the discursive power and intricacies of public recognition. A phrase coined by Charles Taylor (1992; 1994) with a particular emphasis on subaltern groups’ assertion of public identity, “politics of recognition” highlights how forms of difference fundamentally affect how political agents are situated in the public sphere, influencing their capacity for public participation and the sorts of goals these groups work to achieve. According to Taylor, identity is partly shaped by recognition, misrecognition, and nonrecognition from others. In the case of Filipinx Americans, this “nonrecognition or misrecognitions can inflict harm, can be a form of oppression, imprisoning someone in a false, distorted, and reduced mode of being” (Taylor, 1994, p. 25).  Recognizing non/misrecognition as more than just a barrier to self or identity development, Fraser (2000) critically extends Taylor’s politics of recognition to point to the notion that some groups are denied equal “peer” status in social interaction as a result of institutionalized patterns of cultural value. To investigate politics of recognition is then to investigate how discursive representations of identities are assigned lesser value by publics.   Thus, discourse of recognition and its subsequent politics of equal dignity is a driving factor in groups’ positioning in the polity, and can dictate forms of access and rights within the public sphere.  By considering chances of a message’s uptake by strangers, regimes of publicity works to highlight such economies of recognition by laying out the producer-public relationships which influence recognition and acceptance.</p>
                    <p>The methodology I use in this study involves analysis of intended mural meanings by APIA stakeholders and its subsequent uptake by publics. I analyze Detroit’s only Vincent Chin murals in Chinatown and at Grand River Creative Corridor as material fixtures in urban areas that allow an open and visible threshold in which general publics can interact with the APIA represented communities. The murals’ intended meanings and public reactions were gathered from APIA groups’ public documents, news sources, social network testimonies, and personal communication. To demonstrate how regimes of publicity work to decipher factors involving the social uptake of a material claim, I highlight only a number of explicit claims from each of the murals and open discussion of considerable influences to the murals’ strategies and challenges towards public address.</p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis</strong>: The first Vincent Chin mural sat amongst remnants of Detroit’s Chinatown on Peterboro Street and Cass Avenue between the years 2003 and 2017. In a collaboration between the Detroit Chinatown Revitalization Group, the Bogg Center’s Detroit Summer, and the On Leong Chinese Welfare Association, the Vincent Chin mural was erected on the north wall of the building that once housed Chung’s restaurant (425 Peterboro).  It kept company with other APIA material markers such as a kiosk welcoming passersby to Chinatown and the Association of Chinese Americans Drop-In Center, withering signs of Chinatown’s failed attempt to attract the same numbers and level of activity as its previous location on Michigan Avenue and Third Street.  The mural was taken down earlier this year as a result of new property ownership, but the mural’s message had already endured dwindling potential as the area has gradually fallen victim to urban redevelopment plans (Wasacz, 2016).</p>
                    <p>Facing Peterboro Street, it served as a political statement against APIA hate crimes and the inclusion of APIA’s in the Detroit community and history (Wey, 2012; Wasacz, 2016; Detroit Chinatown Revitalization Group [DCRG], 2003). Through its textual images, the Vincent Chin mural’s claim was one of “Justice, Equity, and Diversity” as well as a promise for the creation of a once-again booming Chinatown with images of projected Vincent Chin Museum, and new restaurants, among other new buildings. First, the mural displayed figures relating to identity-movements that had local significance in Asian and African American civil rights: hate crime victim Vincent Chin, Asian American activist and spokesperson for American Citizens for Justice Helen Zia, and Dr. Martin Luther King who’s first “I have a dream” speech occurred down Woodward Ave. Further, the neighborhoods painted in the upper left and right of the mural are of Black Bottom neighborhood, Paradise Valley neighborhood, and the previous Chinatown, predominantly African-American and Asian neighborhoods which were displaced to Cass Corridor following the construction of the Lodge freeway.  These two racial groups displayed by the mural refer explicitly to the area of Chinatown and tie the territory to the identities of two historically racial neighborhoods (DCRG, 2003). Finally, the mural includes a vision for Chinatown’s future, one that mixes a post-industrial experience alongside a rich history of race relations (Detroit Chinatown Revitalization Group 2003). The vision included new grocery stores, restaurants, specialty stores, senior and mixed-income housing, a Vincent Chin Memorial Museum, a venue for celebrations and traditional/folk celebrations, and a historical designation for the neighborhood.</p>
                    <p>Despite the mural’s intentions, it failed to galvanize enough public recognition to bolster change for the struggling Chinatown. As mentioned before, other factors such as urban redevelopment and sparsity of APIA inhabitants play a role in the mural’s failure in the area, but material emphasis and spatial strategy also produce and reflect inclusionary and exclusionary forces involved in the construction of public space, and in turn, reflect representative voices in the public sphere. To begin using Regimes of Publicity as a lens for investigating the mural’s failed message, we start with the first relationship: the mural’s compliance to community and social norms.</p>

                    <p><strong>Community and Social Norms:</strong> <i>Economic potential.</i>One of the major narratives about Detroit’s Chinatown is public interest in its economic potential and/or reviving the bustling economic activity of Detroit’s previous Chinatown on Michigan and Third. The mural’s presentation of new businesses (both Asian and Non-Asian), housing, tourist shops, and a museum promote APIA culture but also contribute to the economic development of the area and its inhabitants. The surrounding area had already witnessed one of the first of many business projects belonging to new redevelopment plans as early as 2005, and the mural included APIA community as inclusively contributing to this business development. By emphasizing APIA-run or themed venues, the mural also aligns itself with the established norms of the area’s Chinatown designation.</p>
                    <p><i>Pre-existing histories.</i>Though the mural supports public economic concern for the area, the mural’s troubling alignment with community and social norms occurs with the designation of the displaced Asian and Black neighborhoods and implied continuance in the new Chinatown territory. By representing two neighborhood communities with specific histories of Chinatown displacement, alongside, more broadly, Asian and Black histories of racial injustice, the mural makes a complex claim of local community and wider public norms. Staeheli, Mitchell, and Nagel (2009) make an important distinction between the terms “community” and “public.”  By using Delany (2003) and Baechler’s (1993) distinction of community as “social solidarity derive[d] from sharing a preexisting history, experience, or identity,” they define the construction of the public as intrinsically requiring the discursive interaction of strangers (qtd. in Staeheli, Mitchell, and Nagel, 2009, p. 643).  However, shared norms of publicness are often interrelated with community norms and vice versa; thus, while community and social norms may lead to social uptake from strangers and participation in construction of the public, certain feelings of publicness may also facilitate communally shared ideals.  As one of the mural project’s coordinators Soh Suzuki pointed out, the mural’s representation of Asian inclusion in a predominantly black area represents a gesture to a larger Detroit public with the inclusion of African American history and presence (Wasacz, 2016). However, it also goes against community and social norms of the area by referring to the previous Chinatown’s inhabitants who are likely not living in the Peterboro and Cass location. Put another way, though the mural aligns itself with the greater demographic of the Detroit public, it territorially asserts the place-identity of specific micro-communities that may no longer have affiliation with the new Chinatown area. A different preexisiting history exists for the residents of the current Chinatown area, signaling a separate community than the neighborhoods represented in the mural.</p>
                    <p><strong>Legitimacy:</strong> <i>Claims of displacement</i>Building from the representation of the displaced neighborhood, the mural’s claim may also pose issues of legitimacy, which negatively affects public uptake. Coordinator Suzuki reiterates in an interview that the mural is meant to remind the public of the troubling history of displacement of people of color (Wasacz, 2016). The contentiousness of this claim may be classified as remarkable under regimes of publicity, and the strategy of reasserting the neighborhoods within the new Chinatown is a territorial act of legitimacy against this continuous political struggle. Similarly, the Arab immigrants in Staeheli, Mitchell, and Nagel’s (2009) study have used comparable legitimating tactics as presenting stories of themselves as rightful citizens within an American locale despite the continuous political push against this idea. </p>
                    <p><i>Hate crime commemoration.</i>The mural thus far strategically presents a mix of legitimate and socially valued messages (economic development; a nod to broad area demographics) alongside remarkable claims (re-territorializing the new Chinatown for two specific neighborhoods; the wrongful displacement of POC communities).  Perhaps the driving legitimating vehicle is the mural’s claim against the Vincent Chin hate crime. Through its title, publicity, and center focus, the mural forefronts the remembrance of Vincent Chin whose wrongful death and lack of justice became a watershed moment for the APIA civil rights community. Though a deeper study could decipher whether the narrative of Vincent Chin is publicly accepted and legitimate under Detroit’s major civil rights heritage, Vincent Chin commemorations in the city broadly fit the standards of “successful” and publicly accepted commemorations according to Goshal’s (2013) considerations of public racial violence memory. In his extensive study of racial violence memory movements – with notable consideration of material commemorative structures – Goshal notes the importance of readily mobilized institutions and groups around the cause, historically accepted perceptions of the victim’s good moral standing, and ingrained notions of the incident’s importance. With yearly commemorations of the Vincent Chin hate crime by Chinese cultural groups, recognition from other APIA groups, and city/institutional support for these efforts across the decades, combined with more than 10 news stories, and a relatively stable narrative of the hate crime’s injustice across celebrations and coverage, the message of Vincent Chin arguably proves to be among the mural’s publicly legitimate claims.</p>
                    <p><strong>Relations of Property:</strong><i>Property ownership.</i>Regimes of publicity’s third relationship emphasizes the importance of a cultural group’s links to property ownership in order to have access to a public space. For example, Arab immigrants in Staeheli, Mitchell, and Nagel’s (2009) study were property owners and residents of Arab Town; thus, their claims of legitimacy in the area were reinforced by the rules and norms of that property and the assemblage of visual markers in Arab Town. Arguably one of the strongest (and final) factors against the mural’s social uptake involved the change in ownership of the property that showcased the mural. The On Leong Chinese Welfare Association ceded ownership of the property in 2016, and the property’s new owners requested the removal of the mural. The mural is now stored away, under the possession of the Detroit Asian Youth (DAY) project whose artists worked on the mural (R. Hwang, personal communication, June 8, 2017).</p>
                    <p><i>Material surroundings.</i>Finally, though it is strategy for groups to contest and reframe norms that involve property – such as the mural’s attempt to reframe Chinatown as a bustling multiethnic arena promoting APIA business and remembrance – these reframings are often challenged by surrounding material surroundings. The mural’s claim interacts and negotiates Chinatown’s space with other fields of visibility, but Peterboro-Cass intersection is only visibly marked by Detroit Bike Shop (across the street, facing the mural), the welcome to Chinatown kiosk, a red-brick walled cinema at the end of Peterboro, and signs for the On Leong Association on the mural’s building. Thus, the mural interrogates the particular public space as a space for diversity, territory of two particularly racialized neighborhoods, and economic space for prospering Asian establishments while other material markers within its field of vision negate these delineations. It’s expected the growing presence of businesses from urban redevelopment plans will exacerbate the erasure of Chinatown’s material markers. </p>
                    <p><strong>Theorizing Spatial Uptake:</strong> Chinatown’s Vincent Chin mural draws on a strategic mix of “safe” and contentious claims to the public, ultimately falls short of meaningful public recognition. Through the lens of regimes of publicity, we see the major forefronting of a publicly accepted hate crime commemoration alongside contentious political concerns surrounding the displacement of POC populations and the territorial reclaiming of Chinatown. It’s possible the material rhetoric of these concerns failed to galvanize enough support for change, as Chinatown and the area’s public uptake remained stagnant and unable to resist development directed from other public and private sphere concerns. Despite decades of property ownership from the On Leong Chinese Association, the mural’s message had gone unfulfilled and redevelopment plans gradually created an assemblage of contesting material markers until the final arbiter, a change of ownership, sealed the fate of the mural and its public message.  The removal of the APIA material marker becomes more than just a failed attempt at public address, but now, further sign of limited APIA representation in a public space that had been publicly designated for the racial group. Ethnic material claims and representation are especially relevant in such cases, as its limited social uptake and eventual removal mark limited public recognition and value for APIA concerns in light of a confluence of other public values (such as economic development, and current majority demographic values).</p>
