                    <p>A stroll to Peterboro Street and Cass Avenue will reveal the remnants of Detroit’s Chinatown: a kiosk welcoming passersby to Chinatown, Association of Chinese Americans Drop-In Center, and a mural of Vincent Chin. Though previously a bustling ethnic area on Michigan Avenue and Third Street, the 1961 urban renewal plan moved Chinatown to its Peterboro-Cass location to make space for the John C. Lodge Freeway (Chan, Kim, and Gauri, 131-132).  The new location, however, failed to attract the same numbers and level of activity as its predecessor as most Chinese inhabitants either moved to the suburbs or, turned away from real estate due to increased post-World War II prejudice, moved out of Detroit entirely (132). Chinatown was left with only a few hundred inhabitants by the 1980s, and despite movements to revitalize the area, has resisted growth.</p>
                    <p>One such revitalization effort came in the form of a Vincent Chin mural in the summer of 2003. Vincent Chin was a Chinese-American murdered in 1982 by two unemployed autoworkers, furious with Japanese-looking Detroiters who represented the more successful Japanese auto industry. The Asian American movement erupted with the unjust verdict of the two workers’ $3,780 fine for the murder (Boggs, 129).  It wasn’t until the Vincent Chin Twentieth Year Remembrance and Rededication to Justice event was celebrated in 2002, that the Detroit Chinatown Revitalization Workgroup collaborated with Detroit Summer and the On Leong Chinese Welfare Association to create a mural memorializing Vincent Chin and a history of social and political movement in the community (130).  The mural’s unveiling which took place on September 13, 2003 was also a signal for Chinatown’s comeback (Suzuki & Lin). Though gradual improvements to Detroit were signs of such a comeback and Asian American groups united in their mural’s message, the visible power of the mural alone was not enough to territorialize Chinatown’s boundaries into an active Asian American space.</p>
                    <p>The mural is located on the north wall of On Leong Association building (425 Peterboro) and faces Peterboro Street. Through its textual images, the Vincent Chin mural’s claim was one of “Justice, Equity, and Diversity” as well as a promise for the creation of a once-again booming Chinatown with images of projected Vincent Chin Museum, and new restaurants, among other new buildings. The mural displays figures relating to identity-movements that had local significance in Asian and African American civil rights: Vincent Chin, Asian American activist and spokesperson for American Citizens for Justice Helen Zia, and Dr. Martin Luther King who’s first “I have a dream” speech occurred down Woodward Ave. Further, the neighborhoods painted in the upper left and right of the mural are of Black Bottom, Paradise Valley, and the previous Chinatown, predominantly African-American and Asian neighborhoods which relocated to Cass Corridor following the building of the Lodge freeway.  These two racial groups displayed by the mural refer explicitly to the area of Chinatown and tie the territory to two historically racial neighborhoods (Mural Brochure, 2).</p>
                    <h2><small>The Mural's Fate</small></h2>
                    <p>The Vincent Chin has been removed from the area in 2017, and is being housed away from public view. Making way for new improvement projects, downtown Detroit is being steadily populated with new restaurants and shops, including a restaurant serving contemporary Chinese-American food in the Historic Chinatown.</p>
