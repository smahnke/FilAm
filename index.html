                    <p>This site explores Filipinx American settlement and their struggle for visibility within Michigan's urban landscape.  Cultural heritage sites provide a form of storytelling that feeds into the ideology of nation-building and works to sustain cultural ties across generations and spaces. However, as place development is characteristic of urban transformation, changes to a city may have the effect of either strengthening or fragmenting urban ethnic space.</p>
                    <p>Considered the region of Asian American “unsettlements,” the Midwest has historically been known for its displacement of the Asian American community.  In stark contrast, states such as Hawaii and California have celebrated spaces in which Asian Americans contributed to the American city. For example, Los Angeles, home of the largest Filipinx American population in the U.S., has recently introduced a new initiative to preserve Asian American landmarks to sustain underrepresented yet significant Asian American spaces. The preservation of Filipino Town and other landmarks serves as a timely push against city development and gentrification which once too Stockton’s Little Manila.</p>
                    <p>Filipinx ethnic enclaves in the Midwest have experienced more difficulty than their western counterparts. Victor Jew (2003) cites numerous attempts by the federal government from the 1940s to 70’s of using the Midwest to resettle and scatter Asian American populations for reasons of disrupting pre-war ties and economic support.  The pattern of dispersal and limited ethnic visibility has continued today, with one major contributing factor being urban development.</p>
                    <p>Michigan’s story of Asian Pacific Islander Americans (APA) visibility is not an uncommon one: it is a story of interrupted spaces and fragmented communities in the face of urban development. With over 100 years of APA settlement in Michigan, the communities' displacement due to zoning laws, prejudice, and urban planning has contributed to such movements as the upheaval and transfer of an entire Chinatown, relocation to the suburbs or other states, and migrations to low-income, crime-infested downtown areas such as Detroit's Cass Corridor.</p>
                    <p>What's at stake in the disruption of these communities is a disruption of sustained cultural practices and values as well as a means of community advocacy and negotiation of resources. The following pages explore (1) the earliest Filipinx American settlements in Michigan, (2) Michigan’s only Filipinx Cultural Center, and (3) Michigan’s APA art/murals.  As visitors to the site, you may choose to explore each of the main pages for a general introduction to Michigan’s Filipinx spaces, or click the various “Read More” buttons for more in-depth place/space analysis of these ethnic sites.  Under both ‘layers’ of content, the site broadly aims to explore the following question: To what degree are Filipinx American and other APA voices representative in the physical urban landscape, and what forces promote and inhibit this voice? Gaining visibility in a locale then largely becomes a question of negotiating public space, the extent to which APA communities can establish claims to space for identity formation, community advocacy, and access to resources.</p>  
                    <p>A look at material structures in the urban landscape helps illustrate how established heritage spaces allow ethnic communities the potential for organizing, gathering, and renewal. It's my belief that oral histories combined with an investigation of the material through cultural buildings, street names, monuments, and art can illuminate the invisible but rich immigrant histories of Midwestern Filipinx Americans and inform of the struggle to sustain ethnic heritage places.</p>
