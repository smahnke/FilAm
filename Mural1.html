                        <strong>Analysis of Potential Impact on the Public Sphere</strong>
                    </h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Methology and Theory</strong>:When analyzing the affordances of murals in terms of revealing the agency to assert identity in a particular space, I must look at it as an act of human territoriality. A group must claim the space by marking something public (like a building) to inscribe their own claim (mural). Further, this claim made public renders visible a certain ethos about that space. To explore Asian American’s agency in achieving territoriality through murals, first a mural’s claim (emitted and presented) must be decoded, particularly in its relationship between identity and the place it is inscribed on.  As a heuristic for decoding, Keating’s cognitive, affective, and instrumental lenses (86) for looking at place will be effective in breaking apart the nuances of a mural’s claim. Cognitive relation informs the territorial or symbolic shape of a place, thus defining its limits and distinctions; Affective relation informs feelings toward the region and the degree to which it forms a common identity; and Instrumental relation informs how the region is used for a particular action.  Furthermore, it is not enough to simply decode the mural’s claim. Within the visual field that a mural presents itself, the space may also be negotiated, supported, or contested by surrounding material actants. Thus, along with the mural’s claim, I also look at how the claim is reproduced and maintained through surrounding material networks in its field of vision.</p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis</strong>According to Brighenti and Karrholm, claims to identity-space such as those seen in murals assert boundaries and thus territory.  Though the pre-existing meaning of the area was largely of a stagnant Chinatown, the temporary reconstruction of the block with the introduction of the mural asserts a territoriality of African American and Asian American communities through its local iconic figures, allusions to civic movements (“Detroit Summer”), and representation of two racially specific neighborhoods.</p>
                    <p>However, the mural alone, though it links a bounded place with a certain identities, results in a relatively unstable place-meaning as a singular, and limited actant in the area’s visible social field. Just as Foucault asserts that power needs constant maintenance, a system of disciplinary measures, tactics, and relations to remain active, so too do assertions of territory need repetitive and parallel networks of visible (material) artifacts to stabilize claims on space. Fairly stabilized territories require what Endres and Senda-Cook refer to as repeated reconstructions over time, or what other researchers have suggested as a continually produced, processual operations that work to produce and stabilize territorialization (Karrholm; Brighenti, 325). The mural’s claim interacts and negotiates Chinatown’s space with other fields of visibility, but Peterboro-Cass intersection is only visibly marked by Detroit Bike Shop (across the street, facing the mural), the welcome to Chinatown kiosk, a red-brick walled cinema at the end of Peterboro, and signs for the On Leong Association on the mural’s building. Thus, the mural interrogates the particular public space as a space for diversity, territory of two particularly racialized neighborhoods, and instrumental space for prospering Asian establishments while other material markers within its field of vision negate these delineations.</p>
                    <p>Because the complexity of the mural’s assertion on territory exist on multiple levels, it is also possible that the mural’s claims coincide with other material networks existent in the area – though perhaps not one explicitly claiming an Asian American space. A whole set of territorial productions may exist among materialities, allowing actants to play multiple roles for different networks of connection. For instance, if we look again at the impact of the mural’s place-making through Keating’s lenses, there are cognitive delineations to the territorial space that are shared across material networks outside of the mural’s many nuanced assertions. Cognitively, the Chinatown kiosk and mural’s reference to the boundary of Chinatown take place on the grounds the city established and recognized as Chinatown for over half a century. What’s more, some non-Asian business residents to the area have recognized this relation by using discovered artifacts from their renovated buildings to restore parts of Chinatown (Galbraith). This makes sense, as the locale’s recognition as Detroit’s Chinatown is stabilized and predictable, if not through its limited population of Asian inhabitants or businesses then by the city’s formal recognition, ethnic-related name, and prominent pre-existing history.  Therefore, some businesses that are not in line with the mural’s affective claims to a common identity or specific claim on the futurity of Chinatown may still connect with other narrative networks, like the recognized boundary of Chinatown.</p>
                    <p>Though not explicitly written over, the mural’s ability to territorialize Asian American space is destabilized by its surrounding visible markers. A vibrant process of reclaiming the space – what Deleuze and Guattari refer to as a territory-making process of events involving territorialization and deterriorialization, linking a series of events to place-meaning -- remains less active on this block. Arguably, the easy concession to Chinatown’s cognitive and affective dimensions leaves little at stake in making explicit claims to space outside of what is already practiced, predictable, and visible. For Asian American claims to space to be more dynamic, however, there needs to be more material networks and practice in line with their idea of Chinatown, and must be maintained and reinforced. What’s interesting is that though the mural may be contested by the visible area, it hasn’t affected its prolonged presence in the area. Further research of the material network may illuminate how concession of the mural’s pointed claim cooperatively aligns with other layers of networked productions in the area.</p>
