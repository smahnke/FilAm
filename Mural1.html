                        <strong>Helpful Terms</strong>

                    <p><strong>Public Sphere</strong> -- a metaphorical space wherein civic discourse defines the concerns and values that ultimately construct the idea of the “public.” Since the sphere ideally functions on a democratized openness to public opinion, the defining of publics shifts. It began with Jurgen Habermas’ term of the public sphere which he believed originated from 18th century autonomous gatherings of public opinion in the U.S. and Europe. Aggregate discourses which would occur in open and autonomous spaces of public opinion would define collective public concern; thus, The sphere counteracted authoritarian claims of public concern and values coming from the political elite rather than a democratized whole. Though Habermas’ public sphere was referring to collectives of conversation instead of concrete, material spaces, he recognized that such civic activity was grounded in concentrated places such as coffeehouses, salons, and print media. These places provide the needed space wherein the circulation of dialogue and action allow for the construction of publics.</p>
                    <p><strong>Public Space</strong> -- a relatively open and inclusive space which is publicly accessible to a wide range of people, behaviors, and viewpoints. These are ideal sites for the formation of socio-political collective which make up notions of the public. However, since these spaces aren’t always completely open (as they are always regulated by such influences as regimes of publicity, for instance), they become arenas in which illegitimate, invisible, and/or marginalized groups work to gain equitable access. </p>
                    <p><strong>Regimes of Publicity</strong> -- a term from Staeheli, Mitchell, and Nagel (2008) referring to a system of laws, practices, and relations which condition the qualities of a public. It assumes that not everyone has access and voice within a public space in order to be representative within the public sphere. A number of socially agreed upon rules already influence economies of public attention which Staeheli, Mitchell, and Nagel outline in three sets of relationships: 
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>community and social norms</strong> – some sense of commonality with the public through aligned concern(s) or history. This commonality and ability to interact in interpretable ways influences the chances of a message’s uptake from strangers willing to engage in discussion over the message.</li> 
                            <li><strong>Legitimacy</strong> – claims must be seen as normal, unremarkable, and legitimate by already existent notions of publicity. This may be difficult for groups vying for public access because they’re already viewed as illegitimate, so many strategies may include demonstrating how practices may be seen as legitimate in other senses.</li> 
                            <li><strong>Relations of property</strong> – the relationships that exist in and through place which regulate who can make claims in that area. This does not just refer to a singular physical place, “but also the set of relationships and rights that make property meaningful as a form of wealth, as a resource in building places and structuring activities, and as imbued with power” (p. 643).</li> 
                        </ul>
                    <p>This last point draws connections with networks of spatiality and can perhaps be seen as a material form of semiotics that work to uphold certain public narratives.  I propose a group’s access to place and property can thus be seen as the beginnings of territorial claims toward public access.</p>
                    <p><strong>Territoriality</strong> -- To read territory is to read a degree of power over space, and certainly their relationship is inextricable. Our behaviors and orientations are daily influenced by material-territoriality; parking lots, buildings, street signs constrict our spatial movements and monopolize a degree of visual public attention.  The relationship between human territoriality and urban public space has opened insights into economies of visibility and public attention, as well as the territory-making capacity of certain groups to participate in spatial forms of public discourse. In Brighenti's (2010) study of graffiti writers and urban territoriality, she moves away from static notions of territorial space and power to seeing territoriality as a process of ongoing negotiations between various stakeholders. This naturally resists primordialist and strategist claims that certain groups are "'naturally' attached to some place or region--such as the 'Fatherland'" or as in strategism, insisting territoriality only refers to establishing control over a given space (p. 324). Brighenti's view of territoriality allows for the concept to be a study of ongoing negotiations of place-meaning and practice that are marked by specific communities and materials. Territoriality is then "deeply social in the sense of something that is coessential to the innner and outer relationships within multiplicity of socii" (p.324).</p>
