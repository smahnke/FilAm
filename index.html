                    <p>This site explores Filipinx American movement and the struggle for representation within Michigan's urban landscape.</p>
                    <p>As place development is characteristic of urban transformation, changes in infrastructure may have the effect of strengthening a sense of place or fragmenting urban space. The story of Asian Pacific Islander Americans (APA) in Michigan is a story of interrupted spaces and fragmented communities. With over 100 years of APA settlement in Michigan, the communities' displacement due to zoning laws, prejudice, and urban planning has contributed to such movements as the upheaval and transfer of an entire Chinatown, relocation to the suburbs or other states, and migrations to low-income, crime-infested downtown areas such as Detroit's Cass Corridor.</p>
                    <p>What's at stake in the disruption of these communities is a disruption of sustained cultural practices and values as well as a means of community advocacy and negotiation of resources. The following pages explore: To what degree are APA voices representative in the physical urban landscape, and what forces promote and inhibit this voice? Gaining agency of expression in a given locale then largely becomes a question of negotiating public space, the extent to which APA communities can establish claims to space for identity formation, community advocacy, and access to resources.</p>
                    <p>A look at material structures in the urban landscape helps illustrate how established heritage spaces allow ethnic communities the potential for organizing, gathering, and renewal. With a specific focus on the Filipinx American community, the following pages explore some of the first Fil-Am immigrant settlements in Michigan, the evolution of Michigan's only Fil-Am Cultural Center, and finally, the Fil-Am struggle to erect city murals. It's my belief that oral histories combined with an investigation of the material through cultural buildings, street names, monuments, and art can illuminate the invisible but rich immigrant histories of Midwestern Filipinx Americans and inform of the struggle to sustain heritage places in the face of urban developmental and economic challenges.</p>

                    <p><strong>Public Sphere</strong> -- </p>
                    <p><strong>Territoriality</strong> -- To read territory is to read a degree of power over space, and certainly their relationship is inextricable. Our behaviors and orientations are daily influenced by material-territoriality; parking lots, buildings, street signs constrict our spatial movements and monopolize a degree of visual public attention.  The relationship between human territoriality and urban public space has opened insights into economies of visibility and public attention, as well as the territory-making capacity of certain groups to participate in spatial forms of public discourse. In Brighenti's (2010) study of graffiti writers and urban territoriality, she moves away from static notions of territorial space and power to seeing territoriality as a process of ongoing negotiations between various stakeholders. This naturally resists primordialist and strategist claims that certain groups are "'naturally' attached to some place or region--such as the 'Fatherland'" or as in strategism, insisting territoriality only refers to establishing control over a given space (p. 324). Brighenti's view of territoriality allows for the concept to be a study of ongoing negotiations of place-meaning and practice that are marked by specific communities and materials. Territoriality is then "deeply social in the sense of something that is coessential to the innner and outer relationships within multiplicity of socii" (p.324).</p>
