                        <strong>Analysis of Potential Impact on the Public Sphere</strong>
                    </h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Methology and Theory</strong>: To investigate the Filipinx community’s ability to lodge claims for recognition, acceptance, and inclusion in the public sphere through physical markers, a theoretical framework must take into account analysis of material claims to space in relation to public attention. The concept of Regimes of Publicity provides one such framework for deciphering how material claims function within the system of laws, practices, and relations that condition qualities of a public. Developed by Staehali, Mitchell, and Nagel (2008), regimes of publicity assumes not everyone has access and voice within a public space to be representative within the public sphere. A number of socially agreed upon rules already influence economies of public attention which Staeheli, Mitchell, and Nagel outline in three sets of relationships: (1) community and social norms – some sense of commonality with the public through aligned concern(s) or history. This commonality and ability to interact in interpretable ways influences the chances of a message’s uptake from strangers willing to engage in discussion over the message. (2) Legitimacy – claims must be seen as normal, unremarkable, and legitimate by already existent notions of publicity. This may be difficult for groups vying for public access because they’re already viewed as illegitimate, so many strategies may include demonstrating how practices may be seen as legitimate in other senses. (3) Relations of property – the relationships that exist in and through place which regulate who can make claims in that area. Though Staehali, Mitchell, and Nagel emphasize the rights of a locale as influenced by property ownership, it also points to spatialized access that is not just read from a singular physical place, “but also the set of relationships and rights that make property meaningful as a form of wealth, as a resource in building places and structuring activities, and as imbued with power” (p. 643). This last point draws connections with networks of spatiality and can perhaps be seen as a material form of semiotics that work to uphold certain public narratives—or in the authors’ case, what is already regulated by property ownership.</p>
                    <p>Regimes of publicity and its application on political geography draw from a number of key theorists.  The concept underscores the discursive power and intricacies of public recognition. A phrase coined by Charles Taylor (1992; 1994) with a particular emphasis on subaltern groups’ assertion of public identity, “politics of recognition” highlights how forms of difference fundamentally affect how political agents are situated in the public sphere, influencing their capacity for public participation and the sorts of goals these groups work to achieve. According to Taylor, identity is partly shaped by recognition, misrecognition, and nonrecognition from others. In the case of Filipinx Americans, this “nonrecognition or misrecognitions can inflict harm, can be a form of oppression, imprisoning someone in a false, distorted, and reduced mode of being” (Taylor, 1994, p. 25).  Recognizing non/misrecognition as more than just a barrier to self or identity development, Fraser (2000) critically extends Taylor’s politics of recognition to point to the notion that some groups are denied equal “peer” status in social interaction as a result of institutionalized patterns of cultural value. To investigate politics of recognition is then to investigate how discursive representations of identities are assigned lesser value by publics.   Thus, discourse of recognition and its subsequent politics of equal dignity is a driving factor in groups’ positioning in the polity, and can dictate forms of access and rights within the public sphere.  By considering chances of a message’s uptake by strangers, regimes of publicity works to highlight such economies of recognition by laying out the producer-public relationships which influence recognition and acceptance.</p>
                    <p>The methodology I use in this study involves analysis of intended mural meanings by APIA stakeholders and its subsequent uptake by publics. I analyze Detroit’s only Vincent Chin murals in Chinatown and at Grand River Creative Corridor as material fixtures in urban areas that allow an open and visible threshold in which general publics can interact with the APIA represented communities. The murals’ intended meanings and public reactions were gathered from APIA groups’ public documents, news sources, social network testimonies, and personal communication. To demonstrate how regimes of publicity work to decipher factors involving the social uptake of a material claim, I highlight only a number of explicit claims from each of the murals and open discussion of considerable influences to the murals’ strategies and challenges towards public address.</p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis</strong>: Though an APIA-oriented organization signed off on the mural, it was purportedly the artist’s “non-local identity” and message that made the mural an instant target of public resistance. Street artist Sintax painted over the mural to contest the Baltimore artist and further admonishes, “This just is not just painting some bullshit ass mural about what you think my city is.” Though it is offered as an Asian American message and approved by a local Asian American group, the identity of the community is supposedly complicated by various implied boundaries that have been perceived and contested by the community: Chin’s relation to Highland Park, Gaia’s relation to Baltimore, to even the mural’s relation to global events. Here, APIA identity and politics is contested in terms of value and belonging with the local public. Gaia, while noting the problematics of revitalization through outside art, articulated this clash in his response, “Buffing the memory of Vincent Chin is a misplaced critique on the murals that are clashing with graffiti. Instead it comes off as a gesture against the Asian community of michigan” (Pisacane). Though Sintax’s main contention with the piece was its nonlocal affiliations, he accedes to the APIA iconography but only with the inclusion of a broader message regarding Native and African Americans. He repainted the mural to include Vincent Chin, among other Detroit figures and famous victims of brutality such as Crazy Horse (mixed African/Native ethnicity) under the banner “Our Land Til Death,” Elijah Mohammad, Aiyana Jones, and Malice Green  (DeVito).  Since its 2014 “rewriting,” the modified mural and reduced APIA message continue to occupy the parking lot on Grand River.</p>
                    <p><strong>Community and Social Norms: </strong> <i>Pre-existing histories.</i> Unlike the Vincent Chin mural on Chinatown, the original mural on Grand River pushes Asian American history to the forefront without other strategically added claims toward community and social norms (i.e. economic development, established designation of an area such as Chinatown, or a nod to the greater demographic of the area). Both the message from Sintax and the outsider status of the street artist Gaia, point to public contention against the mural’s representation of local community values and norms. However, the mural's rewriting still includes Vincent Chin, but only by broadening the claim to include the wider Detroit public’s shared history of major ethnic figures and victims of brutality. </p>
                    <p><strong>Legitimacy:</strong><i>Hate crime commemoration.</i> To build on the last point and the previous mural’s emphasized representation of Vincent Chin, there seems nothing remarkable about the claim and narrative involving justice and remembrance for the Asian American figure.  However, the re-writing of the mural to include predominantly African American historical figures implies that it is remarkable to have this APIA political claim presented on its own. Similar to the strategy enacted in the Chinatown mural to put Chin alongside multiethnic claims (such as its nod to African American figures and history), the Grand River mural was negotiated with Chin off-center and alongside other racial icons. Since Grand River Creative Corridor’s project rules are to alternate murals periodically, a single mural focusing on an APIA group’s message wouldn’t wholly conflate the local public’s identity to that of APIA groups; nonetheless, the mural’s short-lived existence and re-written narrative accommodates their material claim only with the multiethnic inclusion of other Detroit figures.</p>

                    <p><strong>Relations of Property:</strong><i>Material surroundings.</i>Relations of property are complex for this project, as the Grand River Creative Corridor’s director intended the public space to be open to various artists and locals, but he is also responsible for commissioning outsider artists to give their own rendition of Detroit iconography. Nonetheless, artists are welcome to take over murals after each rotation. Currently surrounding a passerby’s view of the rewritten Chin mural are three surrealist representations of faces on the other side of the street, and on the other end of the parking lot, a bare-walled brick art studio with only the words “art in a living context.” The surrounding material assemblage is without explicit ethnic claims but perhaps a promotion of art, neither promoting nor contesting the rewritten Chin mural.</p>
                    <p><strong>Theorizing Social Uptake</strong></p> The Grand River Vincent Chin mural provides an interesting case alongside Chinatown’s mural: in order to comply with community and social norms, APIA political claims generally move toward major local demographics and multiethnic claims as a means to present their own concerns. Though Sintax states the sole Vincent Chin mural was an issue of local identity and territoriality, the keeping of Vincent Chin alongside a greater narrative of African and Native American figures assigns degrees of cultural value and allows APIA inclusion but with some negotiation. To return to Ling’s (2005) Midwestern cultural community model of APIA ethnic enclaves, APIA material claims are indeed increasingly experienced with the heterogeneity of co-ethnic claims, but consideration of the murals’ shifting discourse and social uptake reveal the co-ethnic collaboration a strategic necessity rather than a collaboration that’s always willfully, even “enjoyably” sought.</p>
